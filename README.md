# Accent-Recognition
Accent Recognition using MFCC and KNN for British, Americans, and Africans 

## Steps Invovles
1. Data Collection: Gather a dataset of speech samples from different speakers with various accents. Each speech sample should be labeled with the corresponding accent.
1.  Preprocessing: Preprocess the speech samples to extract relevant features. In this case, you will use Mel-frequency coefficients (MFCCs) as features. The MFCCs capture the frequency content of the speech signal, which is useful for accent recognition. To compute MFCCs, you can use libraries like Librosa or SpeechRecognition.
1. Feature Extraction: Calculate the MFCCs for each speech sample in your dataset. Typically, this involves the following steps:
  - Convert the speech signal into frames using a sliding window
  - Apply a windowing function (e.g., Hamming window) to each frame to reduce spectral leakage
  - Compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of each frame
  - Map the DFT spectrum onto the mel scale, which is a perceptually meaningful frequency scale.
  - Calculate the logarithm of the mel-spectrum to obtain the MFCCs.
1. Data Split: Split your dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.
1. Training: Train the k-NN classifier using the training set. In the k-NN algorithm, the class of a new sample is determined by the majority vote of its k nearest neighbors. You can use libraries like scikit-learn in Python to implement the k-NN classifier.
1. Testing and Evaluation: Use the trained k-NN classifier to predict the accents of the speech samples in the testing set. Compare the predicted accents with the ground truth labels to evaluate the performance of your system. Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
1. Parameter Tuning: Experiment with different values of k in the k-NN algorithm to find the optimal value that yields the best performance. You can use techniques like cross-validation to select the best hyperparameter
1.  Deployment: Once you are satisfied with the performance of your accent recognition system, you can deploy it to recognize accents in real-time or on new speech samples
